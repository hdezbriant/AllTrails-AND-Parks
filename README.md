# AllTrails AND Parks
ALL Parks and Trails
 
Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
What was our motivation?
-Our motivation for this project was to share our passion for the outdoors by making an accessible, interactive website that new users can navigate to easily find parks and trails in any location in the United States.
What problem does it solve?
-This project solves access issues for new users. Going back to our motivation we all agreed initially that sports and hobbies are sometimes difficult for prospective users due to barriers to entry. Our chosen sportâ€™s primary barrier is sorting through large amounts of information and locations. We solved this problem by organizing information based on location and type of outdoor space when the user does their primary search. We have included a log so a new user can write down locations they have already visited. Our map itself features multiple ways to view the map (to be decided by user based on preference) and our marker system identifies targets within range.
What did we learn?
- This was our first group project, so we had the opportunity to practice delegation and communication within our team to achieve the desired result. Along with that, using Git as a group provided challenges we discussed and worked through as a group to overcome.
